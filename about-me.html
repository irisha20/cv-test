          <h2>Hi there ☺</h2>

            <div class="about-me">I'm Irit, married + 2 sons 12 & 9 YO. Love to spend time with my fam, travelling, jogging, doing yoga, meditating and recently found out that I actually enjoy coding. A lot! Essentially, I knew it long ago, back in high school when I chose Computer Science as my major. I continued studying Computer Science as my major also in Colledge, while doing my degree in <a class="about-me-link" href ="images/bachelor.png" target="_blank">Business Administration</a>. I also got a <a class="about-me-link" href="images/teaching-certificate.png" target="_blank"> Teaching Certification </a> of Computer Science for High School students. My first job was a Webmaster & Online Operation Manager which was technical and where I started using my skills for creating web product pages, forms,  HTML Newsletters and working with user Database using SQL queries. But somehow the trajectory of my career tilted to Online Marketing direction. After coming back from a rellocation in Boston (my husband did his Ph.D in Economics&Finance in Harvard), I was very lucky to get into a great company such as 888 as a Search Engine Optimization Manager, it is a marketing field but still requires lots of technical skills and knowledge.

<div class="about-me">
              I enjoyed this field for many years but deep inside, I've always known that I like development. During working in 888 I completed a one year
             <a class="about-me-link" href="images/c-sharp.png" target="_blank">.Net (c#) Development Course</a> but unfortunately didn't do any drastical move for a career change. Perhaps it wasn't yet the time:) It was super fun in 888 and in addition, my boys were very young and I wasn't yet ready for a career change. However, I continuosely sought for technical challenges, whether in completing the Marketing Web tasks myself on Tridion CMS (instead of submitting it to the Webmsters' team) or by learning new stuff, for example, how the marketing sites are built on Drupal from a developer's point of view. I was lucky to have great managers who supported this process, since it was completely out of my primary job scope. Later on I was again lucky to work in 2 great companies: Perion and MobileBrain. At some point i realized that I've got the most of SEO & Marketing field and more than ready to move forward.

          <p class="about-me">

          Recently, I've been learning lots of Full Stack Web Development concepts (in an autotidact manner based on online courses) such as CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, NodeJS & Express, SQL, MongoDB & Mongoose.
          I enjoy every moment of the process and even more when I started working on my first real web app to put together the knowledge I gained.




          <div class="about-me">My app was created to assist my kids to memorize irregular verbs in English and new words for dictations they occasionally get in school. I built it from scratch and the idea is based on a real demand.
          My son kept asking me to write him verbs in a v1 form so he can complete the chart and I was required to check it over and over. Then I realized it might be a good idea to automate the process.
          I used NodeJS with Express, Mongoose, connected to MongoDB Atlas, used different packages etc..
          Won't elaborate here, if interesting, please take a look at the <a class="about-me-link" href="https://github.com/irisha20/learn-english" target="_blank">source code</a>.

          Go ahead and play with LearnEnglish <a class="about-me-link" href="https://thawing-refuge-47380.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">app</a> after you watched the <a class="about-me-link"  href="https://youtu.be/0NS4wIacPlA" target="_blank">tutorial</a>.
